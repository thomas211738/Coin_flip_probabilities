# Coin_flip_probabilities

I created this project to find out the probability of flipping a certain number of heads with a certain total number of flips.

To better explain the project, let me use an example. If you flipped a coin 100 times, and there were 100 heads, then obviously 
the coin is bias. Same thing with 99, and 98 heads. On, the other hand, if the coin was heads 50 or 51 times, we would consider
that coin fair. The question I wanted to answer was at how many heads would the coin be considerd fair or bias. 

To answer this question, I used the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of getting k successes of heads given n flips.
I also used a Cumulative Distribution Function to determine the probability of k or less successes. 

I then graphed out these functions as such:
